Hello there, stranger. I'm Andrea, a 22-year-old BSc student in Computer Science at the [University of Padova](http://www.unipd.it/). You can learn more about me in my [about](/about) page.

I hope this blog will be an interesting collection of ramblings on security, low-level trickery, and reverse engineering. Or anything else that pops into my head.

Stay tuned for the first post!
